# PollyScanner

**PollyScanner** is a next-generation **prediction market intelligence and screening platform**. 

It analyzes real-time probability markets to surface crowd sentiment, conviction shifts, and market inefficiencies. Unlike traditional prediction platforms, PollyScanner functions as a **professional intelligence layer**—turning decentralized prediction markets into actionable signals, dashboards, and probability insights for traders, analysts, and automated systems.
