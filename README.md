# 🔷 Polyscan (Evolution of ScanTrade)

**Polyscan** is an advanced **probability-intelligence and market-screening platform**, evolved from ScanTrade using a fully additive, non-destructive upgrade path.

Polyscan does **not replace** ScanTrade.
It **extends it**.

## 🧠 What Polyscan Is (Rewritten from Polymarket Logic)

Polyscan is:

✔ A **probability intelligence screener platform**
✔ Built on **crypto-native data rails** (Polygon-compatible, USDC-denominated signals)
✔ Transforms **event-based markets into readable screeners**
✔ Converts crowd positioning into **real-time probability metrics**
✔ Uses **smart-contract–verified outcomes** as truth sources
✔ Operates as **peer-derived intelligence**, not house-driven betting

> Think: **Bloomberg Terminal for probability**, not a gambling app.

## 🔍 How Polyscan Differs from Polymarket (Important)

| Polymarket          | Polyscan                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Trading interface   | **Screening & intelligence interface** |
| Buy/Sell shares     | **Observe probability flows**          |
| User wagering       | **User analysis & filtering**          |
| Outcome speculation | **Signal extraction**                  |
| Gambling perception | **Decision intelligence**              |

Polyscan **reads markets** — it does not force users to participate in them.

## 📊 What Polyscan Screeners Do

Polyscan converts raw prediction-market data into:

* 📈 **Probability trend screeners**
* 🧮 **Confidence delta metrics**
* 🧠 **Crowd conviction heatmaps**
* ⏱ **Time-weighted probability shifts**
* 🔄 **Cross-market correlation signals**

All presented as **screeners**, not trades.

## 🧬 Data Safety & Backward Compatibility (Critical)

✔ Existing `scantrade_*` data → **unchanged**
✔ Existing ScanTrade UI → **unchanged**
✔ Existing Vercel deployment → **unchanged**
✔ Existing repo history → **unchanged**

### Polyscan runs in parallel:

* New namespace: `polyscan_*`
* New folder: `/polyscan`
* New manifests, routes, and storage keys
* Zero overwrite, zero migration forced

ScanTrade continues to work exactly as before.
